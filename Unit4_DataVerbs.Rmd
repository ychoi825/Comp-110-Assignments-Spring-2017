# Chapter 8

Glyphs are created by functions starting with geom_. There are many kinds of glyphs, so there are many geom_ functions: geom_point(), geom_line(), geom_bar(), geom_boxplot(), geom_density(), and so on.


## Make a dataset of only Princes

```{r}
Princes <-
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(name == "Prince")
```

## Make it Count vs. Year

!!!
```{r}
the_frame <- ggplot(data = Princes,
                    aes(x = year, y = count))
layer1 <- geom_point(data = Princes, 
                     aes(shape = sex))
layer2 <- geom_vline(year = 1978)
the_frame + layer1 + layer2
```
```{r}
Princes %>%
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, shape = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(x = 1978)
```
